						<p class="Info">The shift from the old Parliament House — now called the Samvidhan Sadan — to the new Parliament building took place on Tuesday, amid a call by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to start a new chapter sans the bitterness of partisanship. The Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Mallikarjun Kharge, urged that the Constitutional values espoused by B.R. Ambedkar be protected.</p>
						<p class="Info">After a group photo of the members of Parliament was taken against the backdrop of the Samvidhan Sadan, and a joint sitting of both Houses held a ceremony in the Central Hall of that building, the MPs moved into their new premises. They were led by the PM, who was followed by the MPs of the ruling National Democratic Alliance, and by the leader of the Congress legislative party in the Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary, who held a copy of the Constitution of India and was followed by Opposition MPs.
